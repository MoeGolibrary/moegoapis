# MoeGo APIs

This repository contains the original interface definitions of public
MoeGo APIs that support REST protocols. Reading the
original interface definitions can provide a better understanding of
MoeGo APIs and help you to utilize them more efficiently. You can also
use these definitions with open source tools to generate client
libraries, documentation, and other artifacts.

## Domain

The MoeGo APIs are organized into one domain `openapi.moego.pet` and multiple paths, each of which
corresponds to a specific version and resource, such as `/v1/auth`, `/v1/appointment`, and
`/v1/customer`. Each path contains one or more core resources, and each product
contains one or more APIs.
