When you click the `Run in Postman` button, you can try out the MoeGo APIs in Postman. Postman is a popular API client that makes it easy to explore and test APIs. You can use the MoeGo APIs in Postman without writing any code.

**Note**: replace the collection Authorization `${Base_64_API_Key}` with your own API Key.

## Domain

The MoeGo APIs are organized into one domain `openapi.moego.pet` and multiple paths, each of which
corresponds to a specific version and resource, such as `/v1/auth`, `/v1/appointment`, and
`/v1/customer`. Each path contains one or more core resources, and each product
contains one or more APIs.
